- AI/ML: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, LangChain, LangGraph
- Data & DevOps: Pandas, Airflow, dbt, Docker, GitHub Actions, SQL, Pydantic, Poetry
- Cloud: AWS, Azure

## Currently Learning
- AgenticAI: reasoning patterns, tool calling frameworks and orchestration
- Security: Web and Application Security
- Cryptography: FHE & Privacy-preserving AI for biometric systems
